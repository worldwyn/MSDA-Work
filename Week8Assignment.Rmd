My computer, a Macbook Pro with a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor runs the simulations very quickly with 100 runs and 1,000 runs.  It is still reasonable, about 7 seconds, with 10,000 runs.  The estimate of probability that at least 7 heads or 7 tails in a row starts with a range of 0.5 to 0.54 at 100 runs.  It tightens to 0.52 to 0.535 at 1,000 runs, and is fairly consistant around 0.543 at 10,000 runs.


```{r}
success.count <- 0
fail.count <- 0
m <- 100
runs <- m
for(j in 1:m)
{
#set number of flips
#print(j)
n <- 100
flip.vect <- vector(mode="numeric",length=1)
for(i in 1:n)
  {
    flip.vect[i] <- rbinom(1,1,0.5)
  }
#flip.vect

result <- "Failure"
target <- flip.vect[1]
count.heads <- 1
count.tails <- 1
max.heads <- 1
max.tails <- 1
#print(n)

  for(i in 1:n)
  {
#print(i)
#print(flip.vect[i])
#print(flip.vect[i+1])
  if(i == n)
  {
    break
  } else
  {
    if(flip.vect[i + 1] == flip.vect[i])
    {
      if(flip.vect[i] == 1)
      {
        count.heads <- count.heads + 1
        if(count.heads > max.heads)
        {
          max.heads <- count.heads
        }
        if(count.heads == 7)
        {
          result <- "Success"
          break
        }
      } else
      {
        count.tails <- count.tails + 1
        if(count.tails > max.tails)
        {
          max.tails <- count.tails
        }
        if(count.tails == 7)
        {
          result <- "Success"
          break
        }
      }
    } else
      {
        count.heads <- 1
        count.tails <- 1
      }
  }
  }
  if(result == "Success")
  {
    success.count <- success.count +1
  } else
  {
    fail.count <- fail.count +1
  }
#max.heads
#max.tails
}
PHat <- success.count / m
print(PHat)
